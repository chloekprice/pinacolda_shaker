The Pinacolada Shaker application demonstrates skills in using SwiftUI to dynamically update the UI of a simple iOS application in response to user input and interaction.

The application begins with a display of ingredients for a virgin pinacolada: pineapple and coconut, as displayed below.

Upon pressing the "shake" button, the UI will automatically, and in real-time, update to display a pinacolada drink!

The user may then click "unshake" to return to the original drink components.
